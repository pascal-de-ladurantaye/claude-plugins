# Atomic Age Style Guide

Style guide for generating images with a 1950s-60s retro-futurist aesthetic inspired by Fallout's atomic age optimism, but rendered with cleaner, more vibrant tones than the game's post-apocalyptic weathering.

## Color Palette (Fixed)

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Vault Gold | #D4A024 | Primary background, key highlights |
| Atomic Teal | #2D8B8B | Accent color, glows, technology elements |
| Rust Orange | #C45C26 | Secondary accent, warmth, energy |
| Cream | #F5F0E1 | Text backgrounds, cards, clean surfaces |
| Charcoal | #2E2E2E | Text, outlines, shadows, grounding elements |
| Chrome Silver | #A8B5C4 | Metallic elements, robotics, machinery |

**Palette rules:**
- Vault Gold dominates backgrounds (60-70% coverage)
- Teal and Orange used sparingly as accents (never compete)
- Cream for any surface requiring legible text
- Charcoal for all text and line work
- Chrome Silver reserved for mechanical/technological subjects

## Visual Motifs (Required)

Include 2-3 of these elements in every generation:

### Atomic Age Symbols
- Starbursts and atom symbols
- Orbital rings and electron paths
- Radiation-inspired geometric patterns
- Boomerang and kidney shapes

### Technical Elements
- Grid patterns (subtle, background)
- Blueprint-style technical lines
- Gear and cog accents
- Vacuum tube aesthetics
- Control panels with analog dials

### Retro-Futurist Technology
- Chrome robotics with rounded, friendly forms
- Rocket fins and jet-age streamlining
- Cathode ray screens with scan lines
- Analog meters and gauges

## Texture Treatment

### Mandatory Textures
- **Halftone dots**: Apply to shadows and gradients (Ben-Day dot style)
- **Paper grain**: Subtle aged paper texture on cream surfaces
- **Subtle noise**: Light grain throughout to avoid flat digital look

### Optional Textures
- Screen print registration offset (for layered elements)
- Subtle vignette darkening at edges
- Faded/worn edges on cards or documents

## Typography Direction

When text appears in images:
- **Headlines**: Geometric sans-serif (Futura, Avant Garde style) or atomic-age display fonts
- **Body text**: Clean sans-serif, high legibility
- **Accent text**: Script or hand-lettered for "friendly" callouts
- **Labels**: All-caps with generous letter-spacing

Avoid: Modern minimalist fonts, thin weights, contemporary tech fonts

## Composition Principles

### Layout
- Strong diagonal energy (optimistic upward movement)
- Clear visual hierarchy with defined zones
- Transformation narratives: chaos → order, raw → refined
- Central focal point with radiating elements

### Framing
- Generous margins with decorative corner elements
- Panel/card arrangements for multiple items
- Floating elements with drop shadows

### Perspective
- Slight isometric or forced perspective for depth
- Items "emerging" toward viewer
- Dynamic angles over flat presentations

## Subject Treatment by Type

### Infographics & Data
- Render charts as retro instrument panels
- Use analog gauge aesthetics for metrics
- Data cards as punch cards or filing cards
- Flow diagrams with vacuum tube / circuit styling

### Characters & People
- Vault-Boy inspired simplified illustration style
- Friendly, optimistic expressions
- Period-appropriate clothing (1950s-60s fashion)
- Slight propaganda poster idealization

### Technology & Products
- Chrome and bakelite material treatments
- Rounded, streamlined forms
- Visible rivets and mechanical details
- Glowing elements in teal or orange

### Environments & Backgrounds
- Stylized rather than photorealistic
- Technical grid overlays
- Starburst light sources
- Atmospheric perspective in muted tones

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

| Avoid | Instead Use |
|-------|-------------|
| Photorealism | Stylized illustration |
| Flat modern minimalism | Textured, detailed surfaces |
| Contemporary color schemes | Fixed palette only |
| Sharp digital edges | Soft halftone transitions |
| Dark/dystopian mood | Optimistic atomic age energy |
| Weathered/destroyed aesthetic | Clean retro-futurism |
| Modern UI elements | Analog controls and displays |
| Thin line weights | Bold, confident strokes |
